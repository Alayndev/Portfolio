            I am a Full Stack Web Developer willing to collaborate with my
            knowledge in cutting-edge web projects. I have experience developing
            web apps with JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.Js, state
            managers (Redux - Recoil), Next.Js, Node.Js, Express, API Rest,
            Postman, among other technologies. I have developed web apps with
            both SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (Firebase) databases, and with ORM
            (Sequelize). My favorite OS is Linux, but I am also comfortable on
            Windows. Among the strengths I have are my resourcefulness, my
            dedication and commitment, my communication skills and my desire to
            learn and improve. I am a person who is always trying to learn
            something new and improve what I already know. That is what
            motivates me and encourages me to keep progressing constantly. I am
            currently working as a freelance Full Stack Web Developer,
            developing with technologies such as Next.Js, React.Js, Node.Js,
            Firebase, Tailwind CSS, among other technologies.
