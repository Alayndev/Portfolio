            Hi! My name is Alayn Saez. I was born and raised in Buenos Aires,
            Argentina. I’m a full stack web developer. I have been studying web
            development over the last year and a half on my own and with online
            courses. I study on my own as well as with courses on platforms such
            as freeCodeCamp, Platzi, APX school and so on. Among the strengths I
            have developed are my communication skills , my strong sense of
            teamwork and mutual collaboration, my proactivity to learn and
            upskill, etc. I consider myself a confident person who can face and
            solve challenges effectively. I’m a person who is always trying to
            learn something new and improve what I already know. I’m currently
            taking a React Native course to upskill and I’m about to complete a
            year full stack web development course on APX school. Therefore, I’m
            looking to leverage the skills I gained throughout these years and
            bring that expertise to collaborate in a project.
